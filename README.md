# Order and Product Microservices with Spring Boot and Spring Data JPA üåêüöÄ


Welcome to the Order and Product Microservices repository! This project showcases the development of two independent RESTful APIs - "Order Service" and "Product Service" - using Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, and Microservices architecture. These APIs provide a seamless way to manage orders and products in a scalable and maintainable manner.

## Project Overview

The Order and Product Microservices repository contains two independent services:

1. **Order Service**: Manages customer orders, processing, and order history.
2. **Product Service**: Manages product catalog, inventory, and product-related information.

The services follow a Microservices architecture to ensure modularity, making it easier to develop, deploy, and scale each service independently.

## Key Features

- **Microservices Architecture**: The project follows a Microservices architecture, enabling easy deployment, independent scaling, and decoupling of services.

- **Spring Boot and Spring Data JPA**: Utilize the power of Spring Boot and Spring Data JPA to rapidly develop robust RESTful APIs with database integration.

- **Scalability and Flexibility**: Each microservice can be scaled independently to handle varying loads and business requirements.

- **API Security**: Implement secure API access using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth2 for each service.

## Technologies Used

- Spring Boot
- Spring Data JPA
- Microservices Architecture
- Database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.)
- Spring Security (JWT / OAuth2)

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:
https://github.com/Manikanth-Reddy/Spring_Boot_Based_Restapi_Using_Microservices.git

2. Navigate to the respective service directories (Order Service and Product Service):


3. Install the required dependencies and libraries.

4. Run each service using Maven:


5. Access the REST APIs in your web browser or API client.

## Configuration

Customize the application's settings by modifying the configuration files (if any) located in the respective service directories. Configure your database connection, API security settings, and other properties as needed.

## API Endpoints

For detailed API documentation and endpoints for each service, refer to the [API_DOCS.md](API_DOCS.md) file in this repository.
